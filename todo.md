# TODO: A lot

- Make [InfinityAPI](src/main/java/net/flamgop/InfinityAPI.java) more feature complete
- Flesh out [net.flamgop.packet](src/main/java/net/flamgop/packet) with more packets (maybe rework packet system so people don't need to manually read bytes)
- Eventually move Main to another examples package, and refractor to work better with the API (that needs to be finished)
- Move tests out of Main to testing package
- Move jLine and preview features to testing package
- Find more problems
